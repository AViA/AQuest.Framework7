    text: 'During the summertime the most pleasant activity is to go to the forest to pick some mushrooms or just to walk. So little Billy with his sister Patricia and his mother decided as well to make a small trip in the forest.  But something wrong has happened - Patricia was bitten by wasp. While her mother tried to help her treating a wound and calming her, Billy has stood out of the path. In the begining he had an impression that nothing bad had happened and that he could easlily find the way back. However, 5, 10 and even 15 minutes passed, but he stilll could not find the way to the path. What can the little boy do all alone in the forest, when everything around looks so frightening and strange?',

It is great that Billy\'s mom is a practical woman - she put in his backpack a flashlight, some food, water and a little box of medecines. Of course nobody plans to get lost in the forest, but it is always better to be prepared. So, no panic and a supply of necessary things is a good beginning. What to do then?',

It is rather dangerous to panic, so he has to sit and think what he can do next. First of all, how can he reach people?',

I have to collect some dry bark, branches or feathers, then find some dry wood and stick. Then I have to make a small hole in the wood, put there a piece of bark and a stick and start to turn it actively. When the spark appears, blow up the fire carefully.',
